          <p id="tribute-info">Margaret Heafield Hamilton is an American computer scientist and one of the first computer programmers, she is amongst the people credited for inventing the term "software engineer". Margaret is known for leading the software team that developed the guidance and navigation system for NASA's Apollo spacecraft, which was critical for landing astronauts on the Moon in 1969.</p>

                <p>Until 1963, she works on the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) project at the MIT Lincoln Lab, which is soon developed for military use in anti-aircraft defense. In a conference she said:<br>

                  <q>
                  What they used to do when you came into this organization as a beginner, was to assign you this program which nobody was able to ever figure out or get to run. When I was the beginner they gave it to me as well. And what had happened was it was tricky programming, and the person who wrote it took delight in the fact that all of his comments were in Greek and Latin. So I was assigned this program and I actually got it to work. It even printed out its answers in Latin and Greek. I was the first one to get it to work.

                <h2>The Moon Landing</h2>
                <p>In July, Apollo 11 lands humans on the Moon for the first time. On a critical moment, the Apollo Guidance Computer developed by Hamilton's team averted an abort of the Moon landing. Minutes before landing, several computer alarms went off interrupting the astronauts' normal displays. Hamilton was prepared for this situation and designed the software to prevent the astronauts and computer from slipping out of sync while still notifying them of priority tasks.</p>
