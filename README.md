## Margaret Hamilton Tribute Page

### A FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification Challenge

#### Description

This is my first coding project as well as my first repository. It consists of a single page that is a tribute to Margaret Hamilton and the prompt comes from FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design certification. At this point I am a coding beginner, I have collected some knowledge about HTML and CSS syntax and how to apply it to responsive and fluid web design. I still have a lot to learn and I learn by doing, so I will engage in more projects in the future. I'm really looking forward to starting my journey with School of Code and I am filled with determination.

#### FreeCodeCamp

[FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) is a non-profit-organization founded by Quincy Larson launched in 2014. It's an amazing free resource for both experience coders and beginners. They offer a wide range of tools, from articles to interactive coding challenges. The best part about FreeCodeCamp is that their curriculum is self-paced and easy to understand. The languages and technologies currently taught are HTML5, PHP, CSS 3, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Sass, React.js, Node.js, Python, Express.js, MongoDB, and Git.

#### Margaret Hamilton

I chose Margaret Hamilton for this project because she is a software engineering pioneer. I feel lucky to have tons of resources to figure out how to code something and I try to make the most of them, but back in the 70's and the 80's a lot of technologies were being developed and used for the first time. People like Hamilton didn't have Stack Overflow or YouTube to ask questions and they had to find solutions themselves. It is thanks to the pioneers that I am able to find answers today, and they have become role models to me. Hamilton's work not only got humans to the Moon, it's also the foundation for resilient software design. Her paradigm of Developing Before the Fact is something I will aspire to apply to my future creations.

#### What I learned from this project

Other than putting into practice what I recently learned about HTML/CSS syntax and setting up my own repository and making commits to it, on this project I learned that sometimes, when things aren't working out on a late afternoon (and you're banging your head against the keyboard out of frustration) is good to take a break and come back to it later. I restarted this project a Monday with some caffeine in my system and was able to solve the problem from earlier. I had to ask myself "Is this really what I was stuck with?" and only then I understood that struggling is also part of the learning experience. While building the page I discovered that there's a lot of different ways to achieve the same thing in code and I tried all of them until I found one that I liked working with for this particular case. Every time I find myself doing something new with the tools I'm learning, my love for coding grows a little bit more.
